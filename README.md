# About
This is the repository of the final project for [Data Science](https://www.unibo.it/it/studiare/insegnamenti-competenze-trasversali-moocs/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2024/467046), the second module of the integrated course in Computational Management of Data (I.C), a.y. 2024/2025 of [_Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge_](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge), at Alma Mater Studiorum 

# The project 
The project focuses on developing a software that allows one to process data stored in different formats in two databases that can be queried. In particular, we worked with one .csv file and one .json file, and created respectively one graph and one relational database. Then, we developed queries methods to retrieve information from each of them, first individually, then combining the information retrived. 

In this repository we uploaded the final code: 
- [impl.py](https://github.com/edotarp/Data-science-group-project/blob/main/impl.py)
- a folder containing the data provided, called [data](https://github.com/edotarp/Data-science-group-project/tree/main/data)
- a folder containing a small section of the previous ones, to test more easily each method: [test_data](https://github.com/edotarp/Data-science-group-project/tree/main/test_data)

As per request we made sure the code passed the basic tests, below we include a screenshot as a demonstration.
